# Azure Certificate Automation
This is a set of scripts that work with the Manage Engine product Key Manager Plus (KMP). The first script is called CAE (Certificate Automation Engine) which does all the work. The second script is a website that for managing the Engine, pulling logs, setting up email, etc. All of this is written in PowerShell 5.1 (for support reasons) and can run on a low end Windows VM. The Engine will have 4 main components that will include: 1. Checking if there are any Expired certs in KMP, then removing them but storing for a specified amount of time. 2. Internal certificates to the company that dont need a Valid CA to use them (Self Signed certs). This will check certs against (Example. A user cert for testing, check to see if the account is active and then renew) different criteria and renew the certificates automatically if needed. 3. Check Azure (Everywhere) to make sure that the certificates being used in all resources has a copy in KMP. If not, find the source and get a copy. 4. Automatically update certificates throughout the Azure environment when a new copy of a cert is uploaded or pulled in.
